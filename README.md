## Project Info
### Project #1 - Conceptual DB design & DB implementation
Website A is a platform where customers write reviews about businesses. The website's customers (users) can leave reviews on various types of businesses they have used and interact with other customers by sharing reviews. This project aims to create a visualization of the ER diagram, and implementation of the database used by webite A. The project is divided into two main parts.  

The projects will be further explained in the corresponding project files.
