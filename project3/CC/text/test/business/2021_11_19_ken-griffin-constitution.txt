In the battle for the Constitution, the traditionalist beat out the insurgents.Ken Griffin, the chief executive of the hedge fund Citadel, was the winner of an auction for a rare original copy of the U.S. Constitution, Sotheby’s, the host of the auction, said Friday. He beat a group of cryptocurrency fans known as ConstitutionDAO, whose bid set off a frenzy of memes, jokes and financial pledges. But ultimately they couldn’t top Mr. Griffin’s $43.2 million offer.The winning bid was more than double the $20 million the item was originally estimated to go for. Sotheby’s said the sale set a record for a book, manuscript, historical document or printed text.“The U.S. Constitution is a sacred document that enshrines the rights of every American and all those who aspire to be,” Mr. Griffin said in a statement. “That is why I intend to ensure that this copy of our Constitution will be available for all Americans and visitors to view and appreciate in our museums and other public spaces.”The first museum to display this copy of the Constitution will be Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark., which was founded by the Walmart heiress Alice Walton.
