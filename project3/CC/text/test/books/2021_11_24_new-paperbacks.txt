New in Paperback: ‘To Make Men Free’ and ‘You Love Me’
TO MAKE MEN FREE: A History of the Republican Party, by Heather Cox Richardson. (Basic, 560 pp., $19.99.) In this 2014 book, updated with a new epilogue for the paperback, Richardson looks back over a century and a half to chart “the twists and permutations as Republicans of many eras waged their internecine battles,” our reviewer, Jonathan Rauch, noted.NOBODY EVER ASKED ME ABOUT THE GIRLS: Women, Music and Fame, by Lisa Robinson. (Picador, 272 pp., $17.) Drawing from decades of interviews with stars like Tina Turner, Stevie Nicks and Rihanna, Robinson’s oral history highlights sexism in the music industry and those who perpetuate it. “Acerbic and authoritative,” as our reviewer, Lauretta Charlton, put it, “the book is best read as a cautionary tale for women tempted by show business.”NIGHTS WHEN NOTHING HAPPENED, by Simon Han. (Riverhead, 272 pp., $17.) This debut novel follows a Chinese immigrant family living in Plano, Texas, and is told through shifting perspectives in a voice that, according to Thessaly La Force, who reviewed the book for us, “embodies the monotony of feeling out of place, of realizing that life continues to roll forward, even if all you experience is inertia.”KRAFT, by Jonas Lüscher, translated from the German by Tess Lewis. (Picador, 224 pp., $17.) “Fraudulence, in Jonas Lüscher’s world, is a universal,” Rob Doyle observed in our pages. In this book, a German professor stuck in a crumbling marriage and a mountain of debt enters a million-dollar contest where he must compose a stirring lecture arguing why the current world is still, despite all evidence, the best of all possible worlds.
