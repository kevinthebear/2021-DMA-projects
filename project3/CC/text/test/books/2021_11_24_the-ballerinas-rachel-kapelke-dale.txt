They’re Ballerinas — and, Quite Possibly, Murderers
I’m a sucker for reworkings of Rex Stout’s classic Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin novels, especially when they play with gender, sexuality and power while staying true to the American midcentury setting — like Stephen Spotswood’s 2020 debut, “Fortune Favors the Dead,” which introduced the private investigator Lillian Pentecost and her younger, more fluid assistant, Willowjean “Will” Parker.The follow-up is even more of a delight. MURDER UNDER HER SKIN (Doubleday, 348 pp., $27) vaults Parker back into her past life as a teenage member of Hart & Halloway’s Traveling Circus and Sideshow, which she left for an apprenticeship with Pentecost. This time out, the women need to uncover who killed Ruby Donner, the “Amazing Tattooed Woman,” who was “an impossible landscape of roses and sailor girls, hearts and mermaids and pirate ships.” Parker’s former mentor Valentin Kalishenko — “knife-thrower, sword-swallower, fire eater” — is the prime suspect.Pentecost and Parker, of course, know better. It’s a pleasure to watch them arrive at that knowledge after sifting through red herrings and peeling secrets back like layers of an onion, all while revealing even more of themselves without guilt or shame.Just like his mystery-writing ancestor, Spotswood understands that the detective story should be sound, but spending time with unforgettable characters is paramount.
