Mystics, Monsters and the Macabre: Visual Books Honor the Occult
GOTHIC An Illustrated History By Roger LuckhurstWITCHCRAFT The Library of Esoterica  Edited by Jessica Hundley and Pam GrossmanTAROT FOR CHANGE  Using the Cards for Self-Care, Acceptance, and Growth By Jessica DoreWhat does “Gothic” mean to you? For me, the word conjures images of an ancient Eastern Germanic tribe, a flying buttress and myself circa 2003, loitering in front of a rack of studded belts at Hot Topic. In “Gothic: An Illustrated History,” Roger Luckhurst sets forth an extensive, macabre taxonomy of the protean genre and its hallmark “pleasant shivers,” dark tendrils grasping through time and space to ensnare gloomy castles, suburban shopping malls and even the most desolate — though maybe not quite unoccupied — reaches of the cosmos.A professor of 19th-century studies at Birkbeck College, University of London, Luckhurst manages to balance granular detail (in the margins I scribbled reminders to myself to investigate further the enticingly breadcrumbed movies, video games and other references) with liveliness and charm. His analysis of the Gothic labyrinth draws a direct line from the Minotaur to Pac-Man. Another chapter is devoted entirely, delightfully, to the slimy horror of tentacles.Luckhurst locates the Gothic in the demilitarized zone between the modern and the ancient, the city and the country, the living and the dead, the self and the other. That last tension has proved particularly fertile in art and culture, birthing a bestiary of monsters (werewolves, changelings, “The Stepford Wives”) whose difference reflects back to us the cruelly policed boundaries of what society will tolerate.
