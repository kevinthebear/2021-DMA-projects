In this debut thriller, three dancers try to conceal their secrets at the Paris Opera Ballet. Delphine is back in Paris after years in St. Petersburg, choreographing a new ballet and hoping to reconcile with her former friends, but their shared past threatens to topple the production.Expect plenty of satire and uncomfortably funny scenarios for the characters in this collection, which run the gamut from a literary magazine assistant to a couple considering a threesome to a Bush administration lawyer.
