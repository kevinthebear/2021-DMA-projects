They Twice Gave Up Everything to Flee Iraq. They Keep Getting Sent Back.
ERBIL, Iraq — In the hostile world of the video game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, or PUBG, to survive you have to parachute onto a remote island and fight to be the last one standing.Bria Ali was a top player, so good that she was able to sell her account with its accumulated virtual weapons for $8,000. Then she used the money to try to pull off another survival act: helping her family get out of Iraq.Ms. Ali and her family are some of the thousands of Iraqi migrants making desperate and at times dangerous attempts to flee Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdistan region. As in the rest of Iraq, despair over the lack of jobs and widespread corruption, combined with efforts by Belarus to drive migrants across its borders, has encouraged a surge of Iraqis to flee for Eastern Europe in recent months.The idea was to travel to Belarus in Eastern Europe and from there make their way to Germany. But the family’s hopes came crashing down at the Warsaw airport three weeks ago when Ms. Ali, 21, her mother and her brothers were forced to board a plane with dozens of others to be sent back to Iraq.
