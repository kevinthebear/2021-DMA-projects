Who Deserves a Lifesaving Organ?
My patient stared straight ahead as the liver specialist delivered the news. Her eyes were wide and unblinking, her mind murky from the toxins of liver disease and low blood pressure.She was not a candidate for a liver transplant, the specialist explained, at least not now. He paused to give my patient and her husband time to absorb the decision. She pulled the hospital blanket up to her chin. Her husband simply nodded. Their daughter would later tell me that her father got “the gist” of the conversation, even if he could not understand the details. When we asked if he had questions, he shook his head. No.After all, what could he say? My patient had stopped drinking only four months earlier, after decades of alcohol use, and most transplant centers look for six months of sobriety in cases like hers. Her medical record told a story of forgotten medications and missed appointments, and as a result, she carried with her the long shadow of “noncompliance.” And though she had loving family members, it was not clear that they could offer the necessary at-home care to ensure her a successful recovery after transplant.My patient was not a “good” candidate for a new liver. As a critical-care doctor, I’ve received this news alongside a patient before. Though my first instinct is often to rail against these realities, I have learned to recognize that transplant teams are doing the impossible work of balancing stewardship of a limited resource with their desire to care for the individual in front of them.
