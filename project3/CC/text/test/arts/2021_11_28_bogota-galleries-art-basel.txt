For 2 Bogotá Galleries, Art Basel Means Business
BOGOTÁ, Colombia — Contemporary art is an export industry in Colombia. Gallerists boast of an abundant supply of homegrown artists, but bemoan a shortage of consumers willing to pay the prices that could support professional careers. If galleries want to sell at the high end of the international market, they need to build connections at global fairs like Art Basel Miami Beach.Those fairs can be a side business for legacy dealers from Manhattan or Los Angeles, where local buyers keep the cash flowing, but they serve as crucial revenue generators for places like Casas Riegner and Instituto de Visión, Bogotá galleries that will show in Miami this year.“Our local market is very limited, very small, and it would be very difficult for us to subsist or to depend on it,” said Paula Bossa, the Casas Riegner curator. “Hopefully, one day we can.”
