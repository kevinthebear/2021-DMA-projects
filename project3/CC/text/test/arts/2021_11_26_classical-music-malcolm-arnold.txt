The Hilarious, Heartbreaking Life and Music of Malcolm Arnold
Five years ago, an advertisement was placed on eBay by a small auction business in Northwest London called FlogIt4U. The listing was rather more highbrow than FlogIt4U’s usual fare; it was a handwritten score, still wrapped in its original tissue paper.It turned out to be the manuscript of Malcolm Arnold’s Seventh Symphony, a work that had been thought lost for 30 years, with movements dedicated to each of its composer’s three children. It is probable that Arnold, during the period he suffered acutely from debilitating mental illness and was placed under the financial jurisdiction of the United Kingdom’s Court of Protection, bartered the score to help cover a debt.That wouldn’t have been an unusual situation for a composer as troubled — and as productive — as Arnold. He wrote nine symphonies, seven ballets, more than 20 concertos and 132 film scores, winning an Academy Award for “The Bridge on the River Kwai,” before dying in 2006, at 84. But Alan Poulton, a composer, pianist and writer who is chairman of the Malcolm Arnold Society, has identified at least 18 more works that have simply vanished.
