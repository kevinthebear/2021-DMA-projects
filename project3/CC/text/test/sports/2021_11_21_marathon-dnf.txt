How to Get Past ‘Did Not Finish’
Leah Ofsevit had long dreamed of running the Boston Marathon. A native of Newton, Mass., she had finished three other marathons before and had qualified for the 2018 installment of the Boston race, which she proudly calls her hometown marathon.But when race day rolled around, the weather hardly cooperated.The temperature on that April morning was around 40 degrees as runners battled pouring rain and hail. Marathon officials would later call the conditions some of the worst in the history of the race. The number of runners who dropped out in 2018 was up about 50 percent from the 2017 race.Ofsevit was freezing. She couldn’t feel her fingers and had stabbing pain in her knees with every step. She climbed Heartbreak Hill but could not go much farther, and hobbled to a water tent at Mile 21 where a friend was volunteering. She fell sobbing into her arms.
