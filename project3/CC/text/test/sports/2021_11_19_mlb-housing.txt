M.L.B. Finalizes Plan to Provide Housing for Minor Leaguers
For many years, one of the biggest concerns of minor league baseball players was where they would live. Often paid below minimum wage, they frequently jammed several beds into one apartment. Some would sign leases in one minor league city only to be stuck with those obligations when they got sent to another level of the minors.Over the past few years, minor league players and advocacy groups have been more public about their plight. On Thursday, Major League Baseball, which took over running Minor League Baseball this year, announced that the owners of its 30 big-league clubs had agreed to furnish the housing for an estimated 90 percent of minor league players beginning with the 2022 season.The exceptions will be the players on major league contracts or the minor leaguers scheduled to earn at least $100,000 over a full season.“This step forward recognizes that the unprecedented nature of the past two years has further exacerbated affordable housing challenges across the country that existed before the pandemic,” Morgan Sword, M.L.B.’s executive vice president of baseball operations, said in a statement. “The owners are confident that this investment will help ensure that minor league players have every opportunity to achieve their dreams of becoming major leaguers.”
